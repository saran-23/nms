* For combining two models we can concatenate. 
* Non-max Supression is used to eliminate the bounding boxes with less accuracy.
* NMS uses the IOU (intersection over union)= intersection / union
* Nms is based on threshold value if we have threshold value 0.5 with iou value 
Iou _> 0.5.
* For this task we need develop two models and obtaining the best bbox by using NMS.

Advantages:
* Remove the box with a lower confidence from list of boxes.

Disadvantages:
* Non- Maximum Suppression has shortcomings in scenes that contain objects with high overlap
